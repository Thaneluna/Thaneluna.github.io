# Introduction

According to Eric Raymond, "English is the working language of the internet." His essay on <i> "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way", </i> talks about that and many more. Most importantly, about why asking a "smart" question leads to efficient and effective help. Sadly, developers ask "not smart" questions which leads to opposite results. Im sure we've all been in this situation where we did not know what types of questions or how to ask them. However, before asking a technical question, do these following tips that Eric wrote:
<blockquote>
  1. Try to find an answer by searching the archives of the forum or mailing list you plan to post to.
  <br>2. Try to find an answer by searching the web.
  <br>3. Try to find an answer by reading the manual.
  <br>4. Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ.
  <br>5. Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.
  <br>6. Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend.
  <br>7. If you're a programmer, try to find an answer by reading the source code.
</blockquote>
If you had no success at the mentioned tips, then next is the easy part, but that depends on what your goals are and how you plan to achieve them.
