__Bouncy__ is a game that contains walls and a simple algorithm that starts the game from a random position and has random generated objects that are required to complete the game. This project was created with JVM eclipse in my first year of ICS. It was a great introduction to OOP (Object Oriented Programming), as well as, how the rest of the semester will go. This game took a few days and in the process I learned a lot and did plenty of debugging, regardless it helped me with debugging and realizing/fixing my errors.

The greatest thing about Bouncy was the experience behind it. In my first year, I discovered that you can have sound effects like they do in the games I are developed today. I used plenty of .wav effects, but the final sound was the most laughable of them all. It was as if the line was eating the object. Because of this, I've managed to try to make coding fun and implement my personality in the game. I could've simply did the mario effect, but the one thing I learned throughout that first year was that coding can be difficult at times; however if you take your time and also NOT procrastinate the final product is satisfying. Therefore, I try to code while also having fun rather that is putting a little twist on things and even doing a little more research on coding that we weren't taught.
