**Zombified** is a game that has a 2D's game main features. 
1. WASD movement
2. Health Bar
3. Windowed
4. Space bar shooting mechanics
5. Sprite movement images

This game was made with the JVM Eclipse, the game was done in my first year of taking an ICS course. Although, challenging very fun to of created. The project received an A, even though there were some bugs. The game was inspired by the actual 2D mobile game _"ZombieVille"_, ZombieVille was an amazing game that I played hours on end when I was in High School. Until once I reached college and was brought with the opportunity to create a 2D project, this game was my first option. The game was all in all, something I would consider doing again, but more present day 2D physics like games.
