**Zombified** is a game that has a 2D's game main features. A zombie shooting game, who wouldn't love a game where you get to kill things and 
1. WASD movement
2. Health Bar
3. Windowed/fullscreen mode
4. Space bar shooting mechanics
5. Sprite movement images

This game was made with the JVM Eclipse, the game was done in my first year of taking an ICS course. Although, challenging it was very fun to of created. The project received an A, even though there were some bugs. The game was inspired by the actual 2D mobile game _"ZombieVille"_, ZombieVille was an amazing game that I played hours on end when I was in High School. Until once I reached college and was brought with the opportunity to create a 2D project, this game was my first option. In this first year, I had many more projects, but this was my favorite. I had the opportunity to not only create a 2d game using Object Oriented Programming, but also the key clicks and sprite movements images were definetly the hardest. The project required endless amounts of research, in order for the sprites to move as well as the main player to have a health bar. Although, the background did need a bit more work as the images were not up to quality expectations that I wanted to use. Zombified also had shooting mechanics. I was able to utlize not only the bullets moving sprites image, but also using what we learned prior to the final project. I learned a lot that semester of ICS 111, and I hope that like Zombieville I am able to create a game like that with current game models and imagery. In that first year from this project, I carried on those ideas and it helped me stay motivated in completing every ICS course to the best of my ability; whether that is learning inside of class or outside. That is why, Zombified is my first game development that made me interested more in programming and the ideas behind most games that are 3D printed today on consoles, iphones, and computer games.
