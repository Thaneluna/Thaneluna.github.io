/* So. What do you think about Javascript so far? If youâ€™re a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?

Javascript is a successful language. I say this because it is unlike anything i've experienced thus far in my journey through the languages. Simple code from Java's programming language like:
'''green
main(String [] args) {
    // Do somethings then call aFunction()
}

void aFunction() {

}
'''
Code such as this is easily manipulated in javascript and is much more easier to use. There isn't a need for a main function, as well as an identifier for the auxilary functions. This is what makes javascript a successful language. However, javascript compared to the cpp language does have similar syntax. For example, creating a variable in both javascript and cpp; var, let, const are used in both. Because of this, I hope to know the difference as I progress through this course.


<JavaScript is easier to type, but more work for the interpreter at runtime. So while you can type up a program in JavaScript much quicker than C++, JavaScript code runs much slower.

Even though this is the case from the statement above. I learned new things about javascript that I didn't know given prior encounters with the language. Out of a few of the newer things, one of them is storing an array in a variable. Such a javascript feature is something I am not familiar with as other programming languages are unable to compute such a task. Another is the arrow functions. With such a trait, code can be shorter whereas other programming languages and prior experience I had did not use arrow functions.

Nevertheless, from a software engineering's perspective, I think that Javascript is a good programming language. I say this because even though it's code runs much slower; the simplicity of the code makes computing an algorithm feel faster because of the many added features in the language. Although again, from my experience, the way your computer runs the code is based on hardware and software capabilities.
