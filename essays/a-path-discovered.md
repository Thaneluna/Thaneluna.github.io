Software engineering wasn’t my first option. Like most High School students, I wanted to do psychology. After doing more research though, I discovered a whole new field that interested me. The field of software engineering, the pioneer of technology. As each day passes by, new companies have developed new software and scientists have been discovering new languages to enhance this field. Similarly, I am discovering new interests with this field like how is it possible that words produce my favorite video games, (insert video games here) how can software be manipulated by languages, and even has me wondering why is this field constantly hiring. From this discovery, I want to learn more about software engineering and develop new skills and experiences.

A few of the skills that I hope to learn is the main reason why this field interested me. One skill is mastering the art of video games. This developing skill occurred to me at the beginning of my college life, but it was manifested in me when I was at the age of five. I grew up on a variety of category games from fps to sport games to role-playing games. Thus pursuing this field has enabled me to be open-minded when it comes to playing games. Now whenever I play video games; I don’t just play it, I picture the way that software engineering takes place. Another skill that I hope to develop is learning the Apple “swift” programming language. Although no classes at Manoa teach the language, I’ve always dreamt of working for Apple when I was in high school. Therefore, developing the ability to code in swift leads me to the experience that I hope to gain from the swift language, which is working for Apple. 

To conclude, this career is a path that I could never steer away from nor forget. Because of constant languages being learned and many opportunities being presented; I will continue to do research on software engineering; even if I must self teach myself a language. Software engineering is a career path that most people aren’t fond about because of the level of difficulty, but in the long run it is worth it. Not only do you get to have fun while working, you get to also learn new skills and experiences. Until that time arrives, I hope that whatever I learn before then ultimately helps me with those goals.
